              application unless you do so.</p>
            <h5 class="bcolor">SUMMARY OF HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
            <span class="b bcolor font pad-bot-70">This summary gives you an overview of the main purpose for which we
              will use the information including personal information collected from you.</span>
            <p><span class="b">Purpose 1 –</span> Managing your application to higher or further education, or
              attendance at a Education Malaysia event If you apply through Education Malaysia, or register to attend
              a Education Malaysia event, you’re accepting our terms and conditions, and entering into a contract with
              us. We’ll collect the personal information necessary to satisfy the purpose of this contract, such as
              personal information to allow course providers to make informed decisions on whether to offer a place on
              a course. This also covers personal information collected from other sources, such as referees, or
              examination and awarding bodies.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Purpose 2 –</span> Sharing personal information with statutory bodies with
              responsibilities for the higher education sector, and to enable academic research into higher education.
            </p>
            <p>
              We share personal information with universities to help them meet or demonstrate they are meeting,
              government aims or policies such as ‘widening participation’ initiatives, which require them to address
              discrepancies in the take up of higher education opportunities between different social groups. We also
              share personal information to enable academic research. We also publish a wide range of reports about
              our higher education admissions schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
              We always try to share information in a way that does not identify individuals, such as by providing
              statistical information. Where personal information is provided in a way that allows individuals to be
              identified, it is done so under contractual terms, and not used to support decisions being made about
              individuals.
            </p>
            <p><span class="b">Purpose 3 –</span> Sending information to unplaced applicants about available
              courses, display advertising, providing services to universities to help their admissions strategies,
              and producing commercial research.</p>
            <p>
              If you apply through Education Malaysia and do not get a place, we may send you course and opportunity
              information on behalf of providers, unless you opt out of receiving this. If you have subscribed to
              other forms of social media or chat e.g. Twitter or Snapchat, Google etc., we may also use their
              remarketing features to support promotion of our services that you have shown an interest in. You can
              stop receiving these adverts by following the advice in ‘Direct marketing, accessing student products,
              and how to opt out’ section of this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>We give analysis to providers, to help them understand and measure the success of their admissions
              procedures and improve them. We do not provide personal information that identifies individuals for this
              purpose. We also may provide statistical analysis to people or organisations undertaking research into
              the higher education sector.
            </p>
            <p><span class="b">Purpose 4 –</span> Enhancing customer experience; We offer services that enhance
              customer experience, which people can opt in to. These include:</p>

            <p> We will obtain a separate consent for these functions, in addition to the terms agreed to when
              applicants and others agree to the terms of service associated with the product.</p>
            <p><span class="b">Purpose 5 –</span> In accordance with any legal or statutory requirements imposed
              on us by government agencies or requests for information from the police, immigration or other law
              enforcement body.</p>
            <h5 class="b">How we verify the information you provide</h5>
            <p>We may take any necessary steps to check with you and other parties, including universities, colleges
              and examination and awarding bodies whether the information you have provided is accurate or complete.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have the right to cancel your application without refunding your application fee if we determine
              (having carried out any necessary checks), or have reasonable belief that your application contains
              false information.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any reason to believe that information we hold about you is not true, complete or accurate
              you must tell us.
              If we need to verify your identity, we may use details in your application by making checks using any
              official, publicly available or commercially available identity checking services. If any adverse
              information is revealed about you we will let you know so that you have an opportunity to respond.
            </p>
            <h5 class="b">Misuse of credit or debit card</h5>
            <p>If you pay your application fee using a credit or debit card that you do not have permission to use, we
              will cancel your application.
              We may also cancel your application if your payment is not honoured, i.e. a bank or credit card provider
              refuses to pay us.
            </p>
            <p class="b">If we need more information about you</p>
            <p>We, and the universities and colleges, may, at any time, ask you, to provide more information about
              your application. For example, we may need to see proof of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>your identity</li>
              <li>your qualifications</li>
              <li>your employment history</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If we do not receive that information after a reasonable period of time and by a set date, or if the
              information is not satisfactory, we can cancel your application without giving you your application fee
              back.</p>
            <h5 class="b">If we make a mistake</h5>
            <p>We try to process applications and decisions efficiently and accurately. However, we are not
              responsible for any mistakes or delays, or any loss or damage suffered by you as a result of any
              mistakes or delays, which are due to the acts or omissions of universities or colleges or which are
              otherwise outside of our reasonable control.</p>
            <h5 class="b">What you can expect from the university or college when you receive an offer</h5>
            <p>When you receive an offer of a place from a university or college, they should also provide you with or
              make available to you, relevant information about course information and costs, such as tuition fees and
              any other relevant costs such as for field trips or specialist equipment required for the course,
              arrangements for making payments to the university or college, and their complaints-handling process,
              including your right to cancel should you change your mind. The university or college should also
              provide you with information about their terms, rules and regulations relating to student conduct, which
              explain your rights and obligations to the university or college and, likewise, their obligations to you
              as a student at their institution.
              You should read and understand this information before making a decision about an offer. If you do not
              receive the required information, or you wish to make a complaint, or if you are not clear about
              anything relating to your offer and the information provided, you should contact the university or
              college directly to ask for further advice.
            </p>
            <h5 class="b">If the course cannot be offered</h5>
            <p>If you become a student, under your contract with the university or college, they must do all they can
              to provide the educational services. If the university or college is unable to provide these services
              for any reason, they should do all they can to keep the disruption to your education to a minimum, for
              example, by offering you a place on a suitable alternative course or providing assistance to help you
              find a suitable alternative place elsewhere.</p>
